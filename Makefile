#
# DESCRIPTION
# ===========
#
# The purpose of this Makefile is to automate the everyday LaTeX typesetting routine.
# Namely, to automate LaTeX compilation and generation of Postscript or PDF output.
#
# 1. As is well-known, LaTeX usually needs two runs to generate a meaningful output
#
# 2. Its output is DVI, which is not satisfactory for modern user
#
# 3. LaTeX creates a *lot* of auxiliary files, such as 'aux', 'log', 'toc' and so on
#
# So users very often tend to create their own shell scripts which do LaTeX compilation,
# namely, compile the source file twice, and then convert output to Postscript 
# (note that 'pdflatex' generates PDF automatically, by-passing DVI).
# As the user moves from one publication to another, they would copy their shell script,
# and, typically, change the script accordingly, so it uses the file name of the new publication.
# And, surely, this works alright, but it does normally require "some" shell programming
# skills (although maybe not very advanced), and modification of your script 
# each time you start a new paper.
#
# We come about with a Makefile instead, which, we argue is much more versatile than
# such home-made scripts. 
# There are many reasons why we choose to use a Makefile instead of a shell script,
# and we explain them in detail at the end of this description; for now we just 
# stress that 'make' is a very wide-spread tool, and is so old that it 
# exists in all Unix distributions [in the end, it's often far more easy to type "make"
# than type a name of some shell script like "./compile"].
# Note that we are actually targeting precisely Unix or Linux users, as the users
# of OS/X or Windows would typically use a commercial environment or integrated editors which
# provide a certain degree of automation in terms of LaTeX typesetting.
#
# This Makefile is highly customizable. There are simple "user controls" (settings)
# which alter the workflow of compilation. There are also more advanced controls 
# which allow you to do small tricks, and finally you can just modify the core 
# of this Makefile if there is a need and you know how to do it.
#
# Note that this 'Makefile' will work and is intended only for *simple* projects. 
# If you are an experimentalist who are writing a report which includes multiple subdirectories,
# C or Fortran source files, data files, figures, or even Makefiles of your own --
# you are better off by yourself. This Makefile will likely not be able to automatically
# guess your ideas about how to compile your complex report and you might find it unuseful
# or ineffective for your needs. It may interfere with your existing assembly tools
# (e.g. you may already have a Makefile). It's not that it's impossible to use it still,
# and, if you are experienced with Makefiles, you can attempt to customize this script
# to the needs of your project and find it rock.
#
# The same may be true for a theorist who is writing a large report
#
#
# INSTALLATION: 
# None. Just copy this Makefile into your working directory. 
# Type "make" if impatient and see what it has for you
#
#
# Examples
# -------- 
#
# In order to explain the use of this Makefile, we provide illustrative examples,
# which, we hope, will prompt the reader to immediately jump into using this tool.
# 
# 1. You have just ONE source TeX file for your paper in your directory, no figures.
#    The following command will create a Postscript
#
#      $ make ps
#
#    Note that Makefile will automatically find the (only) source file in your directory,
#    call LaTeX (twice), and convert the output into Postscript.
#    Since you very often might need to re-compile the Postscript file, 'ps' is made a default goal,
#    and so if you type just
#
#      $ make
#
#    you'll get a Postscript file without even giving a hint which file you want to LaTeX!
#
#    So yes, your steps are: put this 'Makefile' into your directory, type "make" and you get
#    a Postscript file
#
#    Then, a command
#
#      $ make clean
#
#    will remove all '.aux', '.toc' files, but will leave the Postscript in place.
#
#    If you really need a PDF, then just use
#
#      $ make pdf
#
#    and it will convert the '.ps' file into 'pdf'. Trust me, it's faster than type 
#
#      $ ps2pdf AdS2xS5.ps AdS2xS5.pdf .
#
#    Moreover, it will *not* re-generate the '.ps' file - not unless the LaTeX source has been changed. 
#    This is a general feature of 'make' - it will not generate an output file if it
#    thinks the file is up-to-date.
#    If, on the other hand, you add something new about alternative compactification manifolds
#    to your source file, "make pdf" will first re-compile the source into '.ps' and then generate
#    a new '.pdf'.
#    In this sense, "make pdf" implies doing "make ps" as the first step. 
#
#    Now, those people who use 'pdflatex' - say, when writing a presentation - don't need
#    a Postscript, as 'pdflatex' generates PDF automatically. Please see below in "Controls"
#    how to switch this Makefile to using 'pdflatex' instead.
#
#
#
# 2. You have TWO (or more) LaTeX files in your directory. We would not know why.
#    Some of them might be older versions of your text. Some of them may be figures generated
#    by 'xfig' or a similar tool. Some of them can just be temporary pieces of text
#    or formulas which you saved under names "tmp.tex", "t.tex", "test.tex" and so on. 
#    Some of them can have notations, definitions or formatting that you frequently use, and include
#    with directive '\include'.
#
#    We however *assume* that only one text file at a time is used as a "goal", and other
#    files can be considered as irrelevant for the matter of compilation. 
#    Makefile is unable to guess which file your main text is, but it will pick up the
#    *most recently* modified file. If you are doing lots of editing, this will most likely
#    work, as you are constantly changing the main text file, thus making it the "latest modified".
#
#    However, at the first run of 'make', this may not work if your main file is not the
#    one which was modified (or copied, or re-written) most recently.
#    Then you have to provide the goal -
#
#      $ make muon-g2.tex
#
#    will generate a Postscript (or PDF if you've switched Makefile to use 'pdflatex').
#    You can use the TAB key when typing the filename for bash to complete it, 
#    so you don't have to type it all the way.
#
#    You can be more specific if you want,
#
#      $ make muon-g2.ps
#
#    or 
#
#      $ make muon-g2.pdf
#
#    to generate a PDF. 
#
#    If you just need to convert to PDF (which is a "derivative" format, i.e. obtained from Postscript),
#    you can actually type
#
#      $ make pdf
#
#    if the Postscript file already exists (and is the only Postscript file).
#    Makefile will realize: "there is a single Postscript corresponding to a certain TeX file,
#    so let's generate a PDF for that file now as it most certainly is the main text file"
#
#    In order to have Makefile compile the right LaTeX file in a stable fashion without
#    guessing what the latest modified file was, you can just go down below into the 
#    "User Controls" section of this Makefile, and assign your file name to the SRC variable:
#
#      SRC = muon-g2.tex
#
#    Makefile will not ask you for the file name anymore, and "make", "make ps" or "make pdf" 
#    will be there for you.
#    See the "Controls" section of this Description if you need details about which variable
#    does what.
#
#
#
# 3. Texts with FIGURES. If your LaTeX file includes figures, you may be fine. But if you modify
#    or update a figure, you will notice that 'make' will be reluctant to re-compile your 
#    main text (and incorporate the new figure) -- it simply thinks that the Postscript is up-to-date. 
#
#    You have to tell 'Makefile' that your output file also depends on pictures: go to the
#    "User Control" section below, and set up the FIGURES variable:
#
#      FIGURES = chirality-flip.eps  B-meson.eps  LSP-loop.eps
#
#    or, if you're a theorist, 
#
#      FIGURES = Geneva.jpg  St.Genis-Charlys-Pub.jpg  Leman-Fountain.jpg  Chamonix.jpg
#
#    In fact, it may not even really be figures that your Postscript output depends upon, but other kinds of files 
#    which you may modify from time to time -- in which case an exactly similar variable with just slightly 
#    more appropriate name is used:
#
#      DEPENDS = notations.tex  MSc-thesis-style.tex  PPRdarkblue.sty
#
#    If you do so, 'make' will know that if any of these files gets modified, it has to re-do the Postscript.
#
#    (You can put those file names into FIGURES instead of DEPENDS if you want, but we still think the former 
#    variable should be reserved for names like "Fountain.jpg" and "Hiking-Jura.jpg")
#
#    Note: if you occasionally put into FIGURES or DEPENDS a file name that does not exist, 
#          'make' will punch you (indeed, say you're declaring to add a picture of you skiing at Chamonix,
#          while you actually haven't been in Chamonix) - you gotta get that fixed
